# Debugging-AdvancedBreakpoints
The homework from the Lesson 5, Advanced Breakpoints, of Module 3, Debugging, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to create a Console Application that loops from 1 to 100. Throw an exception on 73. Use a breakpoint to break before the breaking situation.
